# Let's Party Invitations

Welcome to Let's Party Invitations! The published code here is designed to manage invitations for your events in a hassle-free manner. Whether you're organizing a birthday party, a corporate event, or a casual get-together, Let's Party has got you covered!

## Overview 

Let's Party aims to simplify the process of sending and managing events, while preserving the tradition of hand-written invitations.
The majority is written in [Go](https://go.dev/), instrumented with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and presented by [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io) for improved observability.

## Note on Code Quality

Given the time pressure under which Let's Party was developed (weekends with good weather conditions), we acknowledge that some parts of the codebase may not be as polished as we'd like them to be. However, we firmly believe in transparency and accessibility to the code. Hence, nobody likes proprietary software, we've made the decision to provide access to the code despite its imperfections.

In the spirit of full disclosure, we advise against scrutinizing certain areas of the code too closely. üêá You may find temporary solutions and other ... things. üòÑ
